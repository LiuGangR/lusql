 Andre Vellino, the first LuSql customer, and supportive bug discoverer;
 Greg Kresko, zealous proof--reader and CISTI Research sysadmin support;
 those developing Lucene directly (Doug Cutting, Erick Hatcher et al.);
 Andrzej Bialecki for creating Luke;
 the participants of the Lucene user list\footnote{\url{http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user}}.
